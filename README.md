# Brushed Up Runner - Mini Jame Gam Project

## Project goal
Brushed Up Runner is my 2nd ever published game project and the first one I have created for a mini-game jam in only 2 days (Theme: can't stop moving; Special Object: a brush).

## Project description
Brushed Up Runner is a fast-paced endless runner, where the Player needs to avoid crashing into paint buckets. They can also collect brushes to gain extra points & unlock new backgrounds.
